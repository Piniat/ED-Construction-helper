# ED-Python-tool
This is just a tool I made as a project to learn a bit of python. It was made because I wanted a automated way to track my progress on buying stuff for colonisation in elite dangerous. It can currently display all journal log events (only some are handled) and it can also track a shopping list with a in-program creator that automatically starts upon choosing tracking mode and no progress.json is found. You can add/edit and remove items from that list inside the program or by directly modifying the progress.json file.
The code definitely is very suboptimal (global variables my beloved).
This was made and (very poorly mind you) tested on linux and windows may have issues though it should work.
