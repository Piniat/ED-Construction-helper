# ED-Python-tool
This is just a tool I made as a project to learn a bit of python. It can currently display all journal log events (only some are handled) and it can also track a currently hardcoded shopping list (you can modify the progress.json to customise it and how much materials are remaining).
The code probably is very suboptimal, especially in a few places.
