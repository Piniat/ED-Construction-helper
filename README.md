# ED-Python-tool
This is just a tool I made as a project to learn a bit of python. It was made because I wanted a automated way to track my progress on buying stuff for colonisation in elite dangerous.<br><br>It can currently display all journal log events (only some are handled), track a shopping list with a in-program creator that automatically starts upon choosing tracking mode and no progress.json is found. You can add/edit and remove items from that list inside the program or by directly modifying the progress.json file and track deliveries to construction areas. 
<br><br>-To track different constructions remove (to delete progress and start a new construction) or move to a different folder (for later to swap for multiple concurrent constructions) Construction_progress.json
<br><br>The code definitely is very suboptimal (global variables my beloved).
<br>This was made and (very poorly mind you) tested on linux and windows may have issues though it should work.
